# AITA Sentiment Analysis Project

This project uses sentiment analysis on comments from the "Am I the A**hole" (AITA) subreddit. On this subreddit people come with an issue and ask if they actually acted in a bad way or is the other side of the conflict overreacting.

The goal of the project is to classify posts as either "A\*\*ole" (YTA) or "Not the A\*\*hole" (NTA) based on the sentiment expressed in the top comment. The sentiment analysis is performed using both stemmed and non-stemmed data. The main tool used is VADER sentiment score.

The outcome is evaluated based on  metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. The results are then saved and visualized for further analysis.

Please refer to the individual notebooks files for more detailed information about each step of the project.
